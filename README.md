# starter-slapp-app

This repository is meant as an example and starting point for building a Slack app on [Beep Boop][bb].  It's written in [node.js](), uses the [Slapp][slapp] library, and takes advantage of the [Slack Events API][slack-events-api].

## Setup Instructions

Once you've created a new [Beep Boop](bb) project with this repo, go to your project's **Settings** tab and enable a Slack App.

Follow the steps laid out in the wizard. You'll want to enable **Event Subscriptions** on your Slack App using the `URL` provided and add subscriptions for the following **Bot Events**:

+ `message.channels`
+ `message.im`

### ðŸ”¥ it up

Once you've finished setting up your Slack App and saved the `Client ID`, `Client Secret` and `Verification Token` on Beep Boop, go ahead and **Start** your project.

### how to set your bot to online ? 

Formely it wasn't possible to set your bot to "online" easily but after some updates slack now allow it.
To do so, you just have to go through [this link](https://api.slack.com/apps) ![desc](http://zupimages.net/up/17/09/imrl.png) 
Then choose your app. After you'll get a link like this `https://api.slack.com/apps/XXDDEEZ/bots` Here's an illustration :
